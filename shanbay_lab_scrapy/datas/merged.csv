Typically these types of cells are used to combat common infections within the human body; they are an essential part of the immune system.The viral cells continue to attach themselves to the CD4 cells and then multiply to destroy them; eventually those affected with HIV become unable to combat both common and uncommon infections.When this happens the patient is said to have full blown AIDS.AIDS is also diagnosed when amount of CD4 helpers left in the body drops below a certain required amount.The first cases of HIV were reported in the United States in 1981 in the cities of San Francisco and New York. Today those affected by the HIV virus can be found throughout the United States and the world.According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there were 33.3 million people living in the world with HIV as of 2010.As of 2010, over 22 million of the 33.3 million adults and children with HIV lived in African countries where the economy allows limited access to the medications needed to treat and suppress the disease. The lowest number of cases is found in North Africa, with the Sudan showing the highest HIV concentration in that region.By the end of 2008, two million people had died of AIDS with 1.9 million of these people living in Africa."

Germans started bringing these trees into their homes in the 16th century. Evergreens represent strength, because they can stand up to a harsh, cold winter. In some cultures, they are believed to ward off evil spirits. Besides that, they also smell great. Trees and evergreen wreaths can be decorated with just about anything: popcorn, candles, lights, apples, berries, small toys, cookies, ornaments, tinsel, garland, and nuts.The first printed Christmas cards started in England in 1843 as a way to remind people to help the poor. The very first printed card said, “A Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to You"" and was sent by Sir Henry Cole. At first, the cards had signs of spring, like birds, animals, children, and fairies. This tradition caught on quickly and is practiced by many around the world.The tradition of hanging stockings by the fire started with the story of St. Nicholas. He wanted to help a poor man and his three daughters, but wanted to be anonymous. As the story goes, he rode by their house on a white horse and tossed three bags of coins down the chimney. The bags were miraculously caught in the girls’ stockings that had been hung there to dry."

While examining the substance of pus in surgical bandages, he observed a microscopic substance in the pus. He named it nuclein because he observed it in the nuclei of cells.In 1928, Frederick Griffith realized that DNA might actually hold genetic information. In 1952, Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase performed an experiment which confirmed that DNA had a role in heredity.In 1953, James D. Watson and Francis Crick proposed the idea that the DNA’s structure was a double-helix.It was not until scientists used x-ray technology that they were to finally able to see the structure of a DNA molecule. In 1953 Rosalind Franklin was the first to take the most accurate picture, which became known as photograph 51, that truly defined the structure of the double helix shape of DNA.In 1962, the Nobel Peace Prize was given to James Watson, Francis Crick, and Maurice Wilkins (an associate of Franklin who had died by 1962.)."

He supposed that these lines were waterways or highways built by alien people on Mars. H.G. Wells’ famous novel, The War of the Worlds, detailed an attack on the human race by Martians. In the 1960s the Mariner spacecraft confirmed that Mars was basically a lifeless planet; however, in 1996, scientists examined a meteorite that came from Mars and found microscopic life on it.Mars has a diameter of 4220 miles, a bit more than half the size of Earth.A day on Mars is approximately 24 hours and 39 ½ minutes. Mars orbits the Sun every 687 Earth days.It is a cold planet, reaching -207 degrees F. and rarely getting above freezing (32 degrees F.).The poles of Mars are covered in dry ice (carbon dioxide) and the amount of ice varies by season.Basalt makes up the outer surface of Mars, due to the volcanic activity in the past.The 900 mile diameter core of Mars is mostly solid, made of nickel, iron, and sulfur. The outer crust is basalt. The core produces a very weak magnetic field. There is evidence of water under the surface.Mars has the highest mountain in all of the solar system, Olympus Mons. It is an inactive volcano that is 15.5 miles high and 372 miles in diameter.Mars has the biggest canyon system in all of the solar system, the Valles Marineris, which is 2500 miles in length and is four miles deep.Mars has two small moons. Deimos orbits east to west, and Phobos orbits from west to east. They are not spherical and are most likely asteroids. The moons were discovered in 1877, by Asaph Hall, at the U.S. Naval Observatory."

Saturn,noun,"Saturn is defined as a planet in our solar system which is know for its rings.Facts About SaturnSaturn was named after a Roman god, Saturnus, who was the god of agriculture.In 1610 Galileo was the first person to see Saturn through a telescope. Its shape puzzled him, because it didn’t look spherical, but looked more like an oval. In 1655, Christiaan Huygens had a better telescope and could see the rings more clearly. Two decades later, Giovanni Cassini made the discovery that the rings were not solid, but made up of particles. He also saw that there was more than one ring, and there was a large gap, 2980 miles wide, between two of them. The gap was called the Cassini Division, named in his honor.Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun, approximately 888 million miles away from the Sun.Saturn has a diameter of about 75,000 miles as compared to the 8,000 mile diameter of the Earth.One orbital period lasts for over 29 years. That means, in Earth time, that one year here is equivalent to over 29 on Saturn.The exact length of a year is 29.42 Earth years.One day on Saturn lasts for 10 hours and 39.4 minutes.Its atmosphere is 97% hydrogen, 2.5% helium, and .5% methane; but, it is believed to have a solid inner core of iron and rocky material.Saturn is the windiest planet, with winds blowing at 1,100 miles per hour.Saturn has a very strong magnetic field.Saturn has 62 moons, with the largest of Saturn’s moons as big or bigger than the Earth’s moon. Many of Saturn’s smaller moons are no larger than comets. Half of the moons orbit Saturn in the same direction as the planet itself.Its most distinctive feature is its seven rings of varying lengths, widths and densities. The rings consist of rocks, ice and space debris.The first probe to fly by Saturn was the unmanned spacecraft Pioneer 11 in 1979. It was exploring the outer planets and discovered two new moons and charted the magnetosphere.Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 flew by Saturn as part of their mission. They both measured the length of a day on Saturn as 10 hours, 39 minutes, and 24 seconds. The Voyager spacecrafts identified 6 more moons on their mission, bringing the total to 17.The Cassini-Huyggens spacecraft was launched in 1997 as a joint effort between the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), European Space Agency (ESA), and Italian Space Agency (ASI) to study Saturn and two of its moons. It reached Saturn in 2004 and captured photographs. The probe went on to study Titan, one of Saturn’s moons. In 2008, NASA extended the mission and renamed it the Cassini Equinox Mission. In 2010 the mission was called the Cassini Solstice Mission and will continue through 2017."

Therefore, the sun rises in the west and sets in the east.Its rotation is slow compared to other planets, with a day lasting the equivalent of 243 Earth days.Venus has no moons.Venus is made mostly of silicate rock.With a surface pressure ninety times higher than Earth’s, life could not survive there.Venus has a thick atmosphere mostly of carbon dioxide.It is covered by clouds of sulfuric acid which move around the planet quickly because of strong winds in the upper atmosphere. The clouds block light and create a greenhouse effect, so Venus’s temperature can reach 900 degrees Fahrenheit.There is and has been volcanic activity. There are high mountains, most likely caused by this volcanic activity, and extremely large rift valleys.Venus has no moons and no one really knows why.Venus has been explored with a fly-by of Mariner 2 in 1962, two Soviet probes and a landing in 1970, photographs by Mariner 10 and t0 spacecrafts from 1975; through 1984, and the U.S. space probe mapping the surface using radar in 1990.Today the details of objects as small as 330 feet across can now been seen on Venus from the images sent back to Earth."
